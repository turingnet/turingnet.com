                                <p>TuringNet is a public chain that creates world’s first open and trustable Artificial Intelligence (AI)
                                   platform. Our solution sets future AI applications and development free from centralized organizations,
                                    serving the best of interests of the community that reshapes AI. We are also reinventing how the public
                                     participates in AI learning, eliminating duplicated AI model construction by centralized organizations,
                                      at the same time ensuring data privacy and security. </p>

                                <p>Short answer is no for now. Instead of collecting funds through the traditional ICO (Community Coin Offer
                                  ing) model, where a significant portion of the tokens are pre-mined, then distributed to investors and com
                                  munity, we are taking a bold new approach. Not saying the ICO model doesn’t work well, but the true value
                                  of tokens in our ecosystem, should play a critical role to incentivize real users who help to grow our eco
                                  system in the long term. We want to ensure the massive public receives maximized benefits on our self-gover
                                  ning platform.</p>
                                <p>Based on all these beliefs, we are introducing a new model — Community Mining Offering (CMO). In this CMO
                                  model, users can obtain TNET Tokens through accomplishing a number of simple mining tasks on TuringNet’s plat
                                  form operated by smart contract. This way, legal and financial risks are both mitigated as users won’t have
                                  to put in real money to purchase these tokens, instead they get rewards by providing valuable of work on our
                                  platform. In the earlier stage, our aim is to lower the bar for the public to participate and start mining
                                  through some light tasks. We are exploring and developing a few different ways that will allow the public
                                  to enter our platform and start mining with minimum learning curves.</p>

                                <p>TuringNet incorporates the next-generation multi-layer blockchain architecture, in order to meet the
                                   requirements of fast speed and large scale data for AI tasks, both in training and inference.
                                   The design idea is to keep the main chain secure and decentralized, while implementing fast transactions
                                    and extensibility to subchains or sidechains.</p>
                                <p>TuringNet also implements multi-layer architecture with more than 10 thousand transactions per second,
                                  and in addition, supports the extensibility for AI as another key innovation. The sub-chains are responsible
                                   for training and inferencing trusted AI models, while the main chain as a public ledger guarantees the
                                   security of transactions.</p>

                                <p>Compared to the current Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus which calculates useless hashes, LBFT(Learning
                                  Byzantine Fault Tolerance) is a next-generation type of consensus, or proof of useful work. The useful

                                <p>TuringNet supports various storage form of the data and parameters.</p>
                                <p>  ●  Training data are often stored off-chain, such as a separate data storage platform
                                   (IPFS 17 for example), or even locally in all or some of the trainer nodes.</p>
                                <p>  ●  Testing data are the key for the consensus on the subchain, so either the entire testing
                                   data for small or medium size problems or the hash of the testing data are stored in the block.
                                    For public testing data, cross validation technique is employed for each iteration to calculate
                                    the loss. For testing data stored off-chain, such as IPFS, it is possible to use certain encryption
                                     technique to ensure only verifiers can access the testing data.</p>
                                <p>Our Machine Learning models are designed to be collaborative and decentralized. This approach enables
                                   mobile devices to keep all the training data local on device, while working concurrently to learn a
                                   shared model, truly getting rid of the need to store data in a centralized platform. Turingnet allows
                                    complete ownership data to its sources.</p>

                                   The main chain of TuringNet as a public ledger guarantees the security of transactions.
                                    Privacy issues are mitigated since user data was never taken out of user devices for training purposes,
                                     but stored in local.</p>

                                <p>As deep learning is becoming the mainstream and is capable of solving increasing numbers of AI problems,
                                  the success of TuringNet as an open and trusted AI platform should be supported by its intriguing and world-class
                                  deep learning virtual machine, named, Graph Virtual Machine (GVM). GVM adopts graphs as AI models, one of the key
                                  components in TensorFlow. The abstraction of a graph can best describe a variety of deep learning network models,
                                  with nodes as operations and edges as data. The team is thriving to port all types of deep learning models to GVM,
                                  while optimizing the model storage and loading in a decentralized environment. Therefore, users and the community
                                  can easily migrate their TensorFlow models into TuringNet and grow TuringNet into one of the world’s largest AI platforms.</p>

                                <p>The innovation of LBFT in TuringNet lies in the integration of AI task execution within every iteration of consensus.
                                  In each iteration, there is a well-defined value regarding the performance, particularly in training AI models, i.e.,
                                  the loss. By voting the minimum loss in each iteration, the consensus is able to select the best performing node and
                                  confirm it with token rewards.<span class="strong">The LBFT consensus mechanism is the hallmark of TuringNet and empowers it as world’s
                                    first blockchain with seamless integration between AI tasks and the blockchain consensus.
                                    Therefore we call it the world’s first true AI consensus.</span></p>

                                <p>The CMO model is different from the traditional ICO mode. In this mode, the project team can not pre-mine the tokens,
                                  which means 100% tokens are by mined by the community. The project team obtains the tokens through donations, and the
                                  investor obtains a certain percentage of the tokens in proportion of the equity ratio.</p>
                                <p>In this way, there will be a strong consensus between the project team, investors and the community, while the traditional
                                  ICO causes conflict of interest. In the CMO mode, community users will be encouraged to get tokens through mining effort.
                                  For community users, the Token is only mined through the workload. We won’t be issuing the tokens at certain price for
                                  users to purchase at the first place, and our model significantly mitigate financial and legal risks. The workload value
                                  is the basis of the token price. In order to motivate users to mine, the project team is motivated to work very hard to
                                  build community consensus and generate higher overall value.</p>
