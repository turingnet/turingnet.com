                                <p>Today’s existing AI models are increasingly owned and controlled by tech giants who offer
                                    cloud-based products and APIs. Such ownership could result in monoplication, unfair service
                                    prices and limit participation of smaller companies to innovate the industry in the long
                                    term. </p>

                                <p>Typical AI system requires massive computation powers for model training and inference. Multiple
                                    centralized systems have built their own siloed data centers, which could lead to enormous
                                    resource waste. There is a great opportunity to organize computational resources from
                                    public in a decentralized but trustable way.
                                </p>

                                <p>Smaller companies and ordinary users are not incentivized participate in advancing AI industry
                                    as there is no fair share of rewards and a high bar to entering such market. Tech giants
                                    are not obligated to pay contributors who want to contribute their computation powers,
                                    as they possess large data centers with much lower cost per unit power. The ecosystem
                                    then separates the public from participating, and further strengthens centralized AI
                                    systems and models.

                                <p>Centralized AI systems are operated separately by their owners. Even though the cost per
                                    unit power is lower, the scales of the systems often lead to enormous cost to run.

                                <p>Training and optimizing AI models require large amount of data. The primary sources of such
                                    training data are from user characteristics and interactions, or copied from enterprise
                                    clients by providing cloud-based solutions. But there has been an increasing risks and
                                    concerns of data sharing and exfiltration without authorization.
